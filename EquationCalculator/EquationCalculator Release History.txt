EquationCalculator Release History:

Version 1.0.1, 14 June 2021:
*Current run variables set to null after use.
*FindBracketsRandomAndVariables sets up nodesWithBrackets directly instead of returning an output queue.
*Changes to properties vs. fields.


Version 1.0.0, 31 May 2021:
*Seperated out from EquationResolver.
*Introduced readOnlyElements vs. currentRunElements, allowing the same equation to be calculated in multiple ways.

Moved here to seperate out areas of responsibility:
 -Finding brackets and Random.
 -Replacing Variables (using valuesOfVariables).
