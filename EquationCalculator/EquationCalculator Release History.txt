EquationCalculator Release History:

Version 1.2.1:
*Renamed files.
*string.Join() used to concatenate version numbers.


Version 1.2.0 - 22 July 2021:
*Expanded use of exception types.
*Num E - Num multiplies the second number by -1 instead of concatenating a minus symbol. 


Version 1.1.0 - 8 July 2021:
*Added CalculatorExceptionMessages.NoEquationDefault for when elements is null or empty.
*Can use E.TestPower(). Fixes bug that 23E23E23 will fail.
*ExpandedEquation renamed to Equation because it is not EquationCalculator's responsibility to expand and validate the equation.
*Functions are calculated before EDMAS.


Version 1.0.1 - 14 June 2021:
*Changes to properties vs. fields.
*Current run variables set to null after use.
*FindBracketsRandomAndVariables sets up nodesWithBrackets directly instead of returning an output queue.


Version 1.0 - 31 May 2021:
*Seperated out from EquationResolver.
*Introduced readOnlyElements vs. currentRunElements, allowing the same equation to be calculated in multiple ways.

Moved here to seperate out areas of responsibility:
 -Determining if the equation contains Random.
 -Finding nodes with brackets.
 -Replacing Variables with Numbers (using valuesOfVariables).
