EquationBuilder Release History:

Known bugs:
"root", "mod" or "e", next to a digit may cause error or wrong answer. 
"23mode24" with Constants 3mod = 6 and e24 = 4 is built as 23%4 not 6*4.


Version 1.0.0, 31 May 2021:
*Seperated out from EquationResolver.
*New UnrecognizedElement as a holding "don't know what this element is right now." If it isn't known during validation, cast it as a Variable or throw an exception (depending on castUnrecognizedElementsAsVariables).
*Splitter, Validator and ElementBuilder more publicly accessible for independent use.
*SplitAndValidate and EquationIsValid moved to their own (static) classes.
*EquationIsValid.Run() no longer outputs anything - it only returns true/false.
*Root as a word operator now supported. ! as a factorial symbol now supported.

Splitter:
*Created my own String.Split() which keeps separators in the output.
*Completely rewritten. Many more equations with strings/elements 'mod' and 'e' are recognized.
*Takes ElementBuilder or Constants in constructor to allow mutiple equations to be run using those same "parameters".
*Uses TextElementEnumerator and StringBuilder where possible.

Validator:
*Can now handle Constants.
*Improvements.

ElementBuilder:
*Moved here.
*Constants now uses an IDictionary<string, string> and made private.
*Public APIs take ElementBuilder or Constants to expose the functionality of ElementBuilder while still keeping it optional.
*Removed ExpectedVariables to seperate out areas of responsibility. They should be handled when actually calculating.
 -Side effects: Digit and Letter Elements are no longer returned (and have actually been removed from EquationElements).
