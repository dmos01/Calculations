EquationBuilder 2 Release History:

Known bugs:
"root", "mod" or "e", next to a digit may cause error or wrong answer. 
"23mode24" with Constants 3mod = 6 and e24 = 4 is built as 23%4 not 6*4.

Version 2.0.1:
*Renamed files.
*string.Join() used to concatenate version numbers.


Version 2.0 - 22 July 2021 (Retroactive, includes 1.2.x):

Handling E:
*Closing bracket to the left or opening bracket to the right is invalid.* Brackets other way round begin/end a section, therefore Eulers.
*Constants on either side are *10^ if made up of a single Element; otherwise invalid.* Increased use of E.TestPower().
*Functions to the left are Eulers.
*Functions to the right are invalid.*
  *because missed the point of *10^. If Euler's, be explicit.

Validator:
*ArgumentSeparator tests if next is IInvalidWhenFirst.
*Attempts to give unclosed brackets equivalent closing brackets at the end of the equation.
*E.TestPower() moved to EquationElements.
*Factorial throws an exception if run on a non-integer.
*General InvalidBracketUseDefault exception message. Previously, (1[2) would trigger closing bracket without opening bracket, which is incorrect.
*In log(e,x), e no longer needs to be alone.
*Logs test if single-Number base is <= 0.
*OneArgumentFunctions no longer need to be followed by an opening bracket if performed on a single number.
*OpeningBracketsStack is Stack<OpeningBracket> instead of Stack<LinkedListNode<BaseElement>>.
*Methods rearranged, including turning some into local functions.
*SetCurrentToPrevious() renamed to Retract().
*Sin-(1+2) is turned into sin[-(1+2)].
*Uses BuilderExceptionMessages.NoEquationDefault when elementsList is null or empty.
*XML comments mention expanding Constants and talk about returning the "expanded list" instead of the "updated list."

General:
*Added SplitAndValidate.CreateImpliedOpeningBracket() and CreateImpliedClosingBracket().
*Expanded use of exception types.
*Implied brackets are now SquareOpeningBracket and SquareClosingBracket.
*When expanding Constants made of a single Element, do not add surrounding brackets.
