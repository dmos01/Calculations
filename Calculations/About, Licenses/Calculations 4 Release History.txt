Calculations 4 Release History:

Known bugs:
"root", "mod" or "e", next to a digit may cause error or wrong answer. 
"23mode24" with Constants 3mod = 6 and e24 = 4 calculates as 23%4 not 6*4.

Version 4.1, 14 June 2021:
*HistoryController no longer controls the listbox and export buttons.
*History's "Use Selected..." menu appears when right-clicking an item; delete option added.
*Insert calculation tooltip mentions brackets.
*Uses EquationBuilder and EquationCalculator 1.0.1, and EquationElements 1.1.0.


Version 4.0, 31 May 2021:
*All projects and class libraries moved to the same solution.
*Digit and  symbol buttons are now 1 font point larger than function and E buttons.
*Intersections removed as a result of the EquationResolver changes.
*New and rewritten class libraries, with increased separation of responsibilities.
*Rebuilt as a .NET Core 3.1 project.

*New CalculatorAndAnswer makes it easy to switch between NumberFormats, and between radians and degrees, without using SplitAndValidate again. By making it a subclass of the Controller class, it uses the Controller's Radians and CurrentAnswerFormat properties.

*Constants (U.I.):
 -Dropdown and Name textbox merged.
 -Multi-line Description textbox.
 -Search, Name and Value textboxes now line up.

*Constants (Code):
 -GetNameValuePairs (replacing GetKeyValuePairs) returns an IDictionary copy of sortedConstants.
 -Implement IComparable and overloads equality (based on Name).
 -NameWithoutSpaces no longer stored inside each Constant.
 -Support for mod, root and e surrounded by digits. However, when found (moved to MainWindow/Constants Tab), a warning question is given to the user. They are now found with regex.IsMatch().


Featured changes in class libraries:
*Expanded use of error messages containing the applicable parameter.
*Increased use of design patterns.
*Resource files to assist with localization.
*Root now available as a word operator; ! now available as a factorial symbol.
*String equality now primarily uses CurrentCultureIgnoreCase.
*ToLowerAndRemoveSpaces replaced with RemoveSpaces due to IgnoreCase being used for most string comparisons. All Lower variables replaced with WithoutSpaces variables.
*Top-Heavy Fractions uses IsApproximatelyThirdsOrSixths.
*Word name validation now prevents the same name as operators (mod and root).
