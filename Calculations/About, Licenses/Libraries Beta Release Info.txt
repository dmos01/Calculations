EquationElements and Other Libraries Beta 1 Info:

Beta 0.5.0, 5 September 2019:
(Work started 17 July 2019.)

*Now several class library projects. These compile into dlls so they are truly independent of the UI.
*Code separated into different files.

*Element types split into their own classes and interfaces so the code can use 'is' and 'switch'.
*New ElementBuilder for turning strings into Elements.
*New "Number" Element improves decimal-or-double use: if created using a double, decimal cannot be used. It also allows scientific-notation numbers to use a single NumberElement.

*Many new unit tests.
